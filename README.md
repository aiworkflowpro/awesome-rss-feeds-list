> 🎯 **Algorithms wrap you in a filter bubble, platforms chain you to a timeline, and AI-generated content is destroying the signal-to-noise ratio — RSS is the last pillar for taking back control of what you read.**
>
> The most complete open index of **English** RSS feeds. We aggregate open-source upstream lists → HTTP-validate every feed to drop dead links → organize by topic → keep **8936+ live feeds** across **21 categories**, with AI as a first-class focus.

---

## Why This List

Most RSS collections are one-time link dumps that rot as feeds go dark. This one is maintained:

- **HTTP-validated** — every feed returns a live status and at least one parseable item before it lands here, and is re-checked periodically
- **English-only, topic-classified** — feeds are sorted by their *actual content*, not just their upstream source, so each category stays on-topic
- **AI as a first-class focus** — split into Research & Labs, Engineering & LLM, and News & Insights instead of buried in a generic "tech" bucket
- **Source-preserved** — every upstream list is credited, and the full validation funnel is published in [stats.json](stats.json)

> [!TIP]
> Import [feeds.opml](feeds.opml) to grab all 8936+ feeds at once, or pick a single category below.

## 🤖 Using it with Claude Code / Codex

Hand an OPML file from this repo to Claude Code or Codex and a couple of sentences, and you have an information pipeline with zero deployment:

```text
Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiworkflowpro/awesome-rss-feeds-list/main/feeds/en-ai-research.opml,
parse every feed with feedparser, fetch the article bodies from the last 24 hours,
and write a 500-word digest grouped by topic to my notes.
```

---

## ✅ Why every feed works

Every feed is validated over HTTP (status 200 + a feed content-type + at least one parseable item) before it lands here, and re-checked periodically. Dead links are dropped. The validation funnel is published in [stats.json](stats.json).
